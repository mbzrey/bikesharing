And as you flew home together, you look through your vacation photos and had a realization.
One of the key ingredients to the magic was an unlikely suspect: CtiBike.
You and Kate had of CitiBike which allowed you to really know he city and interact with the people who live there and commute
A germ of an idea starts to form in your mind:
What if
You and Kate started brainstorming
Funding
This is an exciting process.
But you know

From there


## Results

To show the potential market and use of bike sharing in Des Moines, we've analyzed data from Citi Bike, a bike sharing compay operaing in New Yk City, which provides actual information of its widespread use. Tha analysis made is performed on the data of august, 2019, since it's expected to have a wider use in the summer, due to the number of visitors as well as the accomodating weather on that particular month of the year.

There were 2,344,224 trips in august, 2019. Over 75% of them were made by subscribers, while the rest were made by occasional customers.
This is an important point to notice: while it was assumed that August would be a great month to analyze, due to the assumption that tourists would use the service, it seems that it is used more as a means of transport than a city-landscaping type of tourism.

As it is expexted, most of the trips' durations are less than an hour long; the most frequent time duration is 5 minutes, with 146,752 trips taken during August, 2019.

Information provided by Citi Bike shows the gender of the rider. While there are some cases that is declared "unknown", it can be affirmed that most of the users are males. However, the trips' duration carries the same trend, for shortes trips being the most frequent.
